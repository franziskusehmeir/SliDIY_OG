== System specification for a motorised camera-slider

_Ehmeir Franziskus & Tea Leon_

=== Initial situation

The higher technical education institute Leonding is a medium-sized
school in the central region of Upper Austria. One of the four
departments is IT media technology. There, media production is a clear
focus of the education.

=== Status quo

In video productions, sliders have been used to make stable horizontal
and vertical shots for many years. These can be motorized or not.

=== Problem definition

Motorized sliders are very expensive and usually unaffordable for the
average user. Cheap alternatives are not motorised and this again
creates a risk of shaky footage or irregular camera movement speeds.

=== Task formulation

Creation of an affordable slider system that can be controlled via a
microcontroller with an app

=== Objectives

More film-loving people should be given the opportunity to own a cheap,
motorized slider system.

=== User stories

* As a content creator, I want to create smooth, horizontal and vertical
camera movements.
* As a nature photographer, I want to create a moving time lapse.
* As a teacher, I want to give my students the opportunity to work with
professional equipment that is affordable.
