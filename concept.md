# Concept for a motorized camera-slider

<br>

## Introduction / Environment

A slider is a "rail system" that allows smooth camera movements.
Motorized versions are very expensive and non-motorized systems again create a risk of shaky footage or irregular camera movements.

<br>

## Starting position / current situation / analysis

### Initial situation
The higher technical college in Leonding is a medium-sized school in the central region of Upper Austria. One of the four departments is IT media technology. There, media production is a clear focus of the training.

### Current situation
In video productions, sliders have been used for many years to make stable horizontal and vertical shots possible. These can be motorized or not.

<br>

## Target system / target proposals

### Aims
The development of an affordable slider system that can be controlled  with an app via a microcontroller.

### Target groups
People that are interested in Film, but have a very small budget.

### Conflicting goals
Easy to use, portable system
<br>
Wiring, 3D printing, fragility

<br>

## Implementations

### First technical realization
ESP32 + Stepper Motor + C++ Code

### Second technical realization
ESP8266 + stepper motor + necessary hardware for connection (stepper motor driver h-bridge)
Blynk app
