=== 3D-Case

image:./images/3d_box.jpg[3d-case,title="3d-Case"]

We used https://www.tinkercad.com/[Tinkercad] for modeling our 3D-Case since it is made for people who have
never touched a 3D-modeling software like Blender or Cinema4D. Tinkercad is a simple web-based modeling-tool.
You have to export your 3d-model as a STL-file for the 3d-printing.

other option to Tinkercad:

* Blender
* Cinema4D
* Meshlab
* Meshmixer
* Microsoft 3D Builder

There are no strict rules on how to design your case, so model it the way you want or download our model!
